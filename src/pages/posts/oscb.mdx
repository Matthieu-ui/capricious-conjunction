## Introduction

This is an open source project that I created to help the open source community share their projects and ideas. I created this project using React, TailwindCSS, and Netlify. I also used the Netlify CMS to create a content management system for the project. The project is still in development, but you can check out the project [here](https://js-community-board.netlify.app/).

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a community board for the open source community to share their projects and ideas. I wanted to create a project that would help the open source community grow and help people find projects to contribute to. I also wanted to create a project that would help people learn more about open source and how to contribute to open source projects.

## Project Features

The project features a content management system that allows users to create posts and share their projects and ideas. The project also features a search bar that allows users to search for specific projects and ideas.
