## What is it?

This is a project I began in a web applications class that I took a step further by creating a helpful resource for students to learn PHP. The website is a collection of PHP tutorials that I have written and a collection of PHP exercises that I have created. The tutorials are written in a way that is easy to understand and the exercises are designed to help students practice what they have learned.
